I am pleased to express my full support for Special Power Sources (SPS) SBIR Phase \FOAPhase\ proposal to the \FunderDepartment\ (\FunderAcronym), titled ``Thermal Management and On-Site Energy Technologies for Data Centers'', in response to DE-FOA-0003504, topic \Topic\Subtopic. \BidderShort\ will serve as the prime contractor and Brayton Energy, Energy Concepts and MINCO Technologies will serve as subawardees.

I believe \BidderShortâ€™ proposed development of Hybrid Electric Propulsion Systems (HEPS) will provide crucial resilience capability to Labatt Food Service Data Centers, located in Texas and New Mexico.  If successful, Labatt Food Service will upgrade our facilities to use HEPS technologies in conjunction with our overall microgrid strategy.

The HEPS being developed by team members SPS, Energy Concepts, Brayton and MINCO offers a promising solution to reduce fuel consumption, provide reliable backup, and lower operational costs for data centers. However, as noted in the proposal, the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and turbogenerator (TG) components requires research and development funding, particularly in meeting strict data center uptime and recovery requirements. The application of HEPS technology presents a unique opportunity to optimize modular configurations, critical factors in the successful scaling of the HEPS technology.

The expertise of SPS and Brayton in this area is impressive, and I am confident that their collaboration will lead to meaningful improvements in the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of Data Center Operations. I look forward to the outcomes of SPS' analysis and pilot-scale implementation, as these advancements hold the potential to drive greater efficiency and cost savings in data center power technologies.

\textbf{As the host site for Phase II HEPS, if awarded, Labatt will employ the technology for use as backup or primary power in our San Antonio data center in order to guarantee the continuity of that facility's critical data center operations.}

I strongly support SPS' proposal and encourage the Office of Science to prioritize their efforts. The successful implementation of this research will have a lasting impact on enhancing the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and scalability of powering data center operations using fossil fuels as the primary feedstock.
